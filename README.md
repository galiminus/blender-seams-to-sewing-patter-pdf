# troubleshooting

**I'm getting a python error**\
That's bad, please let me know the error and how you triggered it.

**After unfolding, there's some weird long triangles /strips flying out**\
Most likely some non-manifold geometry, overlapping vertices, or bad normals.\
Disable the remesh option and see where it goes wrong in your mesh / UV'seams

**My mesh is imploding on itself during clothsim**\
Yeah, clothsim... Try balancing the "pressure" and "sewing force".\
It can help to keyframe the "pressure" to something very high on frame 1 and decrease over time.

# responsibility 🌱

The production of natural textiles often involve overuse of water, fertilizers and perticides.\
Synthetic textiles are a large, often overlooked source of plastic pollution.\
The textile industry is often associated with unethical work conditions.

If you wish to use this add-on for real-life sewing purposes, I ask of you to use only sustainable / second-hand fabrics.

# known issues

- UV's are messed up after Remesh
